react-webpack-stylus-starter
============================

Minimalistic project stub for (React.JS)[http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html] with webpack as module system and Stylus for styling.

For build project just run ```gulp``` from root of the project. And happens some magic:
1. All js would be packed with (Webpack)[https://github.com/webpack/webpack]
2. All .styl files would be built with (Stylus)[https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus].
3. On port 9002 would be launched Connect static server.
4. We would watched for every change in app folder.
5. And of course we would notified when every cycle of build would be completed.

Enjoy your Hack!
