react-webpack-stylus-starter
============================

Minimalistic project stub for [React.JS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) with webpack as module system and Stylus for styling.

For build project just run ```gulp``` from root of the project. And happens some magic:

1. All js would be packed with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

2. All .styl files would be built with [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus).

3. On port 9002 would be launched [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) static server.

4. We would watched for every change in app folder with [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) watcher.

5. And of course we would be notified [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier) when every cycle of build would be completed .

Enjoy your Hack!
