# Dogescript
Dogescript is potentially the greatest language on the internet. Not that this has anything to do with these docs, just couldn't resist adding it. It has a very simple and straightforward compiler that only takes two options, documented [here](https://github.com/remixz/dogescript#javascript) - only difference is that accord takes these via an options object rather than direct parameters, as usual.

Full options in an example:

```js
dogescript = accord.load('dogescript');
dogescript.render('wow', { beauty: true, trueDoge: true })
```
